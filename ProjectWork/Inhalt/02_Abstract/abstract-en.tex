In this thesis the object detectors \textit{You Only Look Once} and \textit{Single Shot MultiBox Detector} are compared for precision, reactivity, training and inference behaviour and examined for their potential for industrial use. The background scenario of the \textit{Smart Warehouse} offers live video data of a drone with goods in a warehouse, which are to be classified and localized in real time. In the future, this should make it possible to carry out inventories and inventory analyses of a warehouse in a time- and cost-efficient manner conserving resources.

The goal of this feasibility study is to find out whether the \textit{Smart Warehouse} scenario is technically feasible and economically reasonable. In addition, the focus is also on the object detectors themselves and their differences in architecture and behavior in the \textit{Smart Warehouse} environment.
